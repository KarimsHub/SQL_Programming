## MORE ADVANCED QUERIES

# Find the number of employees
SELECT COUNT(emp_id)
FROm employee;

# Find the number of employees have supervisors
SELECT COUNT(super_id)
FROM employee;

# Find the number of female employees born after 1970
SELECT COUNT(sex)
FROM employee
WHERE sex = 'F' AND birth_date >= '1970-01-01';

# Find the average of all employees salaries

FROM works_with
GROUP BY emp_id;

# Find the number of money each client is spending

GROUP BY client_id;


## USING WILDCARDS
## % = any number of characters, _ = one character

# Find any clients who are an LLC (GmbH)
SELECT *
FROM client
WHERE client_name LIKE '%LLC';  --> name has to end in LLC

# Find any branch suppliers who are in the label business
SELECT *
FROM branch_supplier
WHERE supplier_name LIKE '%Label%'; --> label is anythere inside the name

# Find any employee born in october

other way:
# Find any employee born in october
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE birth_date LIKE '____-10%';

# Find any clients who are schools
SELECT *
FROM client
WHERE client_name LIKE '%school%';


## UNION - combine result of mutiple select statements in one

# Find a list of employee and branch names
SELECT first_name
FROM employee
UNION
SELECT branch_name
FROM branch;

# Find a list of all clients & branch suppliers names
SELECT client_name, branch_id
FROM client
UNION
SELECT supplier_name, branch_id
FROM branch_supplier;

# Find a list of all money spent or earned by the company 
SELECT total_sales
FROM works_with
UNION
SELECT salary
FROM employee;


## JOINS

##INNER JOIN --> only the branch managers get included
# Find all branches and the names of their managers
SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name
FROM employee
JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id;

##LEFT JOIN --> all of the employees get included because all of the rows of the left table (employee) get included but only the rows of the right table which match get included
# Find all branches and the names of their managers
SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name
FROM employee
LEFT JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id;

##RIGHT JOIN --> all of the branches get included because all of the rows of the right table (branch) get included but only the rows of the left table which match get included
# Find all branches and the names of their managers
SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name
FROM employee
RIGHT JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id;


## NESTED QUERIES

# Find names of all employees who have sold over 30k to a single client

SELECT employee.first_name, employee.last_name
FROM employee
WHERE employee.emp_id IN (
    SELECT works_with.emp_id 
    FROM works_with
    WHERE works_with.total_sales > 29999
);

# Find all clients who are handled by the branch that Michael Scott manages

SELECT client_name
FROM client
WHERE branch_id IN (
    SELECT branch_id
    FROM branch
    WHERE mgr_id = 102
);

## ON DELETE

DELETE FROM employee
WHERE emp_id = 102;

ON DELETE SETS NULL --> sets the value of the associated values in the other tables to NULL, mostly used when the foreign key is not the primary key
ON DELETE CASCADE --> erases the whole row of associated values to the erased row, primary key can't be NULL so we have to use this if the associated values are primary keys
